	Hello world! My name is Christian Dinh, and like many others, I enjoy video games.
	I am currently working on the first year of my undergraduate degree in computer science at the University of Texas 
	at Austin, which at the moment has me designing and implementing data structures in Java. 
	<br><br>In my free time, I have taken a deep interest in video game design and development, 
	particularly level design, programming, and music. To this end, I have become quite familiar
	with development tools such as Unreal and Source, as well as some DAWs (Digital Audio Workstations)
	including FL Studio and Audacity. In addition, I have some experience doing rapid-prototyping in
	Game Maker, which includes scripting with GML (Game Maker Language). <br><br>As far as programming knowledge
	goes, I am comfortable working in Java, C#, and Python, as well as HTML/CSS for basic web design. 
	If you are at all interested in what I have to offer, I encourage you to visit my contact 
	page and get in touch with me.
